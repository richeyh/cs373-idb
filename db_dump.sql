Mother was pushing forty when they married and my father was forty-two.  My older brother was named Joseph.  Nineteen months later I, Mary, was born. Three and a half years later, my little brother, John, came along. <br/><br/>We lived in a very nice section of the Bronx on a street off Pelham Parkway. I loved our house.  I still love it.  After my father died, when I was eleven, my mother had to sell it. <br/><br/>I went to Saint Francis Xavier Grammar School.  Two years ago I went back and was Principal for a Day.  Escorted by two of the tiniest children, I was led into the auditorium while the whole student body sang \"Hello Mary.  You\'re back where you belong.\"  I still tear up thinking about it.<br/><br/>I was awarded a scholarship to Villa Maria Academy which is in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, otherwise I couldn\'t have afforded to set foot in it. <br/><br/>I went to Woods Secretarial School and at eighteen had my first full-time job as Secretary to the creative director of Remington Rand\'s in-house advertising agency. If I were making that choice now I would have gone to college even though God knows we needed the income.  On the other hand the three years I spent in Remington Rand was a tutorial in advertising which served me well when I was widowed with five small children.  Another plus was that I left Remington to be a flight stewardess with Pan American Airways and when my contemporaries were seniors in college, I was flying to Europe, Africa and Asia.<br/><br/>Warren Clark and I were married on December 26, 1949 and had five children in the next eight years; Marilyn, Warren, David, Carol and Patricia. Warren died of a heart attack in 1964.  The highest compliment I can pay my kids are that they are like him.<br/><br/>I sold my first short story when I was twenty-eight.  It was alled \'Stowaway\'.  It had been rejected forty times before a magazine in Chicago bought it for one hundred dollars.<br/><br/>My first book was about George Washington.  It was published in 1969 and disappeared without a trace.  Three years ago Simon and Schuster co-published it with the Mount Vernon Historical Society and retitled \'Mount Vernon Love Story\', it became a bestseller.<br/><br/>My first suspense novel \'Where Are the Children\' was bought in 1974 for three thousand dollars by Simon and Schuster.  Thirty-three books later, I\'m still with S&amp;S.<br/><br/>Time to wind up - at least for the present.  As soon as I sold \'Children\' I enrolled in Fordham College.  Went there for five years at night and earned a B.A. in Philosophy.  Summa cum laude, if you please. <br/><br/>I never thought I\'d marry again but ten years ago I threw a cocktail party on St. Patrick\'s day.  My daughter, Pat, urged me to invite John Conheeney.  Her opening words about him were, \"Have I got a hunk for you!\"  He came to the party and we were married eight months later.<br/><br/>I\'m Honorary Chairman of FraXa Research.  My grandson, David, has the Fragile X syndrome, which is the second leading cause of retardation after Downs Syndrome.  Basically the brain of the people who have it can\'t send out the proper signals because there\'s a kind of short circuit in the synapses that carry the signals.  We raise money for research with the goal of finding a medication that will work around that short circuit.  I go all over the country to the fund-raisers as new chapters of FraXa are opened.<br/><br/>I\'m always asked to name my favorite book.  They\'re ALL my favorites.  If there is one book that is very special to me, it is my memoir \'Kitchen Privileges\' because writing it made me relive my early life including those first struggles to become a writer.  I think \'Kitchen Privileges\' is both tender and funny and it\'s me.\n                </span>',2,'2016-04-09','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31GYnTs3M6L._UX250_.jpg'),(2,'J.R.','Ward','J.R.

All his books combine dramatic narratives and meticulous research. . . .<br/><br/>\" \'King Leopold\'s Ghost\' had an extraordinary impact, attracting readers the world over, altering the teaching and writing of history and affecting politics and culture at national and international levels. Published in English and translated into 11 additional languages, the book has been incorporated into secondary school curricula and appears as a key text in the historiography of colonial Africa for college and graduate students. But it is within Belgium that Hochschild\'s work has had the most dramatic impact, demonstrating the active and transformative power of history. The publication of \'King Leopold\'s Ghost\' forced Belgians to come to terms for the first time with their long buried colonial past and generated intense public debate that so troubled Belgian officials that they reportedly instructed diplomats on how to deflect embarrassing questions that the book raised about the past. The book offered welcome support for others in Belgium who sought acknowledgment and accountability for Belgian actions in the Congo. . . .

Packing up her work-in-progress for HQN Books; her dogs, Sadie and Bernice, and her four horses, the author of more than 70 novels bid farewell to her home in the desert and returned to the place of her birth, Spokane, Washington.<br/>The daughter of a town marshal, Linda grew up in Northport, WA, a community of 500 on the Columbia River, 120 miles north of Spokane.  Her childhood remembrances include riding horses and playing cowgirl on her grandparents\' nearby farm.  Her grandparents\' spread was so rustic that in the early days it lacked electricity and running water.  <br/><br/>As delightful as this childhood was, Linda longed to see the world. After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, she left to pursue her dream.  Because of the success of her author career, Linda was able to live part-time in London for several years, spend time in Italy and travel to such far-off destinations as Russia, Hong Kong and Israel.  Now, Linda says, the wanderlust is (mostly) out of her blood, and she\'s come full circle, back to the people and the places she knows and loves.<br/><br/>Before Linda begins her writing day, she takes her first cup of coffee while enjoying the scenic view of the wooded draw behind her new home. The first morning there, a snowfall blanketed the pine trees, something she had missed in the desert outside Scottsdale. Still enamored with the people she came to love in Arizona, she says she will still set books in that starkly beautiful area, and, of course, in other stories the action will take place in Washington.<br/><br/>Devoted to helping others pursue their dreams, the author will launch her sixth round of Linda Lael Miller Scholarships for Women in May of this year.  A talented speaker, she donates all her speaking honoraria to her scholarship fund.  The stipends are awarded to women who seek to better their lot in life through education.<br/><br/>It\'s no wonder the protagonists in Miller\'s novels are women her readers admire for their honor, courage, trustworthiness, valor and determination to succeed, despite overwhelming odds. \'These qualities make them excellent role models for young women,\' Miller explains. \'The male leads possess equally noble traits that today\'s woman would be delighted to find in her life\'s mate.\'<br/><br/>The author traces the birth of her writing career to the day when a Northport teacher told her that the stories she was writing were good, that she just might have a future in writing.  Later, when she decided to write novels, she endured her share of rejection before she made her first sale.<br/><br/>Although Linda has written successfully in other genres, she is best known for stories set in the West\'stories like McKETTRICK\'S CHOICE (HQN Books March 2006 paperback); THE MAN FROM STONE CREEK (HQN, June 2006 hardcover) and that very first novel, FLETCHER\'S WOMAN, which is being reissued in 2006.

Compelling, passionate, haunting, brilliant: these are the words that have been used to describe the work of #1 New York Times-bestselling author Daniel Silva.<br/><br/>Silva burst onto the scene in 1997 with his electrifying bestselling debut, The Unlikely Spy, a novel of love and deception set around the Allied invasion of France in World War II. His second and third novels, The Mark of the Assassin and The Marching Season, were also instant New York Times bestsellers and starred two of Silva\'s most memorable characters: CIA officer Michael Osbourne and international hit man Jean-Paul Delaroche. But it was Silva\'s fourth novel, The Kill Artist, which would alter the course of his career. The novel featured a character described as one of the most memorable and compelling in contemporary fiction, the art restorer and sometime Israeli secret agent Gabriel Allon, and though Silva did not realize it at the time, Gabriel\'s adventures had only just begun. Gabriel Allon appears in Silva\'s next nine novels, each one more successful than the last: The English Assassin, The Confessor, A Death in Vienna, and Prince of Fire, The Messenger, The Secret Servant, Moscow Rules, and The Defector. Silva\'s forthcoming novel, The Rembrandt Affair, will be published on July 20, 2010.<br/><br/>Silva knew from a very early age that he wanted to become a writer, but his first profession would be journalism. Born in Michigan, raised and educated in California, he was pursuing a master\'s degree in international relations when he received a temporary job offer from United Press International to help cover the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Later that year Silva abandoned his studies and joined UPI fulltime, working first in San Francisco, then on the foreign desk in Washington, and finally as Middle East correspondent in Cairo and the Persian Gulf. In 1987, while covering the Iran-Iraq war, he met NBC Today National Correspondent Jamie Gangel and they were married later that year. Silva returned to Washington and went to work for CNN and became Executive Producer of its talk show unit including shows like Crossfire, Capital Gang and Reliable Sources. <br/><br/>In 1995 he confessed to Jamie that his true ambition was to be a novelist. With her support and encouragement he secretly began work on the manuscript that would eventually become the instant bestseller The Unlikely Spy. He left CNN in 1997 after the book\'s successful publication and began writing full time. Since then all of Silva\'s books have been New York Times and international bestsellers. His books have been translated in to more than 25 languages and are published around the world. Silva continues to reside in Washington with his wife and teenage twins Lily and Nicholas. When not writing he can usually be found roaming the stacks of the Georgetown University library, where he does much of the research for his books. He is currently at work on a new Gabriel Allon novel and warmly thanks all those friends and loyal readers who have helped to make the series such an amazing success.\n                </span>',1,'2016-04-09','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21UzNboTQ0L._UX250_.jpg'),(76,'Amanda','Quick','<span>\n                    \n                    The author of over 50 New York Times bestsellers, JAYNE ANN KRENTZ writes romantic-suspense in three different worlds: Contemporary (as Jayne Ann Krentz), historical (as Amanda Quick) and futuristic (as Jayne Castle).

Realizing he didn\'t have the right stuff for a pro career, he shifted gears and majored in accounting at Mississippi State University. After graduating from law school at Ole Miss in 1981, he went on to practice law for nearly a decade in Southaven, specializing in criminal defense and personal injury litigation. <br/><br/>One day at the DeSoto County courthouse, Grisham overheard the harrowing testimony of a twelve-year-old rape victim and was inspired to start a novel exploring what would have happened if the girl\'s father had murdered her assailants. Getting up at 5 a.m. every day to get in several hours of writing time before heading off to work, Grisham spent three years on A Time to Kill and finished it in 1987. Initially rejected by many publishers, it was eventually bought by Wynwood Press, who gave it a modest 5,000 copy printing and published it in June 1988.<br/><br/>That might have put an end to Grishams hobby. However, he had already begun his next book, and it would quickly turn that hobby into a new full-time career. When he sold the film rights to The Firm to Paramount Pictures for $600,000, Grisham suddenly became a hot property among publishers, and book rights were bought by Doubleday. Spending 47 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list, The Firm became the bestselling novel of 1991.<br/><br/>The successes of The Pelican Brief, which hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and The Client, which debuted at number one, confirmed Grisham\'s reputation as the master of the legal thriller. Grisham\'s success even renewed interest in A Time to Kill, which was republished in hardcover by Doubleday and then in paperback by Dell. This time around, it was a bestseller. <br/><br/>Since first publishing A Time to Kill in 1988, Grisham has written one book a year. His other books are The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, The Chamber, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Partner, The Street Lawyer, The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House, Skipping Christmas, The Summons, The King of Torts, Bleachers, The Last Juror, The Broker, Playing for Pizza,The Appeal, The Associate, Ford County, The Confession, The Litigators, Calico Joe, The Racketeer, Sycamore Row, Gray Mountain, and Rogue Lawyer. All of them have become international bestsellers. In addition he has written six novels for Young Adult readers: Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer, Theodore Boone: The Abduction, Theodore Boone: The Accused, Theodore Boone: The Activist, Theodore Boone: The Fugitive, and Theodore Boone: The Scandal (2016). There are currently over 300 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, which have been translated into 29 languages. The Innocent Man (October 2006) marked his first foray into non-fiction, and Ford County (November 2009) was his first short story collection. Partners (March 2016) was his first original digital short story. Nine of his novels have been turned into films (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, A Painted House, The Runaway Jury, and Skipping Christmas), as was an original screenplay, The Gingerbread Man.<br/><br/>Grisham took time off from writing for several months in 1996 to return, after a five-year hiatus, to the courtroom. He was honoring a commitment made before he had retired from the law to become a full-time writer: representing the family of a railroad brakeman killed when he was pinned between two cars. Preparing his case with the same passion and dedication as his books\' protagonists, Grisham successfully argued his clients\' case, earning them a jury award of $683,500--the biggest verdict of his career.<br/><br/>When he\'s not writing, Grisham devotes time to charitable causes, including most recently his Rebuild The Coast Fund, which raised 8.8 million dollars for Gulf Coast relief in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He also keeps up with his greatest passion: baseball. The man who dreamed of being a professional baseball player now serves as the local Little League commissioner. The six ballfields he built on his property have played host to over 350 kids on 26 Little League teams.<br/><br/>Photo credit Billy Hunt\n                </span>',1,'2013-04-27','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JrhQGPrOL._UX250_.jpg'),(90,'Meg','Wolitzer','<span>\n                    \n                    I am a fiction writer who, like most writers, is happiest when I\'m working.

During one clearing operation, he observed a group of Marines approaching a cave-like structure in a rural area outside the city. After searching thousands of buildings and similar structures without issue, they were tempted to assume that all was clear, but the platoon was alerted to danger by an explosive-detector dog. Ritland learned later that a grenade booby trap had been set in the doorway and would certainly have killed the first marines to enter.

He first became interested in real estate after successfully buying and selling properties to supplement his income while stationed in Phoenix, Ariz. After working for both a 100-percent commission company and a traditional brokerage, he co-founded RE/MAX in 1973. <br/><br/>Forty years ago, Dave revolutionized the real estate industry when he created the RE/MAX business model, which combines a maximum commission concept with world-class support services. The name \"RE/MAX\" was coined from the words \"real estate\" and \"maximums.\" The model continues to attract experienced, top-producing agents who lead the industry in individual sales and professional education. The RE/MAX Balloon is one of the most recognized corporate images in the world and has become a symbol of the leading real estate network.<br/><br/>In 2011, Dave was named the Inman News \"People\'s Choice\" Most Influential Real Estate Leader. In 2010, he was included in Bloomberg BusinessWeek\'s profiles of the 50 Most Powerful People in Real Estate. Dave has been featured in Entrepreneur, Forbes, Fortune, Inc., Success and other leading publications and media outlets across the globe. He received the Warren Bennis Award for Leadership Excellence from the Global Institute for Leadership Development and has been inducted into the International Franchise Hall of Fame, the Council of Real Estate Brokerage Managers (CRB) Hall of Leaders, the Real Estate Buyer\'s Agent Council (ABR) Hall of Fame, and has earned the Council of Residential Specialists (CRS) Special Achievement Award. <br/><br/>Dave had a horrific staph infection along his spine in 2012. It was the worst his doctors had ever seen. He slipped into a drug-induced coma for the next four weeks, had organ failure, flat-lined at one point and faced the possibility of permanent paralysis. Weeks of intensive care were followed by months of rehabilitation. The experience took this self-made business icon to the brink of despair. But, supported by family, friends, health care professionals and a lifetime of positive influences, he refused to quit, battling back and building a goal-oriented plan to survive.\n                </span>',1,'2013-04-27','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-qNNhKMWL._UX250_.jpg'),(103,'Eric','Schmidt','<span>\n                    \n                    Eric Emerson Schmidt (born April 27, 1955) is an American software engineer, businessman, as well as the executive chairman of Alphabet Inc (formerly named Google).

Twenty years is a long time by any yardstick, but particularly when measured in television years. <br/><br/>As we say most proudly, thanks to more than 5-million of you nightly, The Factor remains the most watched program on cable news, as it has throughout this time.<br/><br/>There is no letup in the planning and expectations for the show. Bill notes, \"Looking ahead, politics is going to dominate, politics is really where we are at. We are going to dominate the election coverage, we are going to be ahead.\"<br/><br/>Of course, as those of you familiar with the hard working Mr. O\'Reilly are aware, his presence is felt in many places these days. In fact, you might call him practically ubiquitous. Some examples:<br/><br/>Bill\'s latest book, Killing Reagan, is out, following in the path of the others that went to # 1 on the New York Times bestsellers list. The Reagan story takes you behind the scenes of a president caught up in violent times. <br/><br/>As the description says, it is \" told in the same riveting fashion as Killing Lincoln, Killing Kennedy, Killing Jesus, and Killing Patton.... (Killing Reagan) reaches back to the golden days of Hollywood, where Reagan found both fame and heartbreak, up through the years in California governor\'s mansion, and finally to the White House, where he presided over boom years and the fall of the Iron Curtain. But it was John Hinckley Jr.\'s attack on him that precipitated President Reagan\'s most heroic actions.\"<br/><br/>Highly successful National Geographic Channel movies have already been made of Bill\'s books, with Killing Jesus, nominated for a primetime EMMY, just as Killing Lincoln was before it. <br/><br/>Coming up on National Geographic, there will be a movie made from Killing Patton and Killing Reagan. Bill also serves as Executive Producer on the Fox News Channel\'s Legends &amp; Lies, the real story of the legendary figures of the American West. Season two is on the horizon. <br/><br/>In addition, you can be on the lookout for Bill on the major television talk shows where he is a coveted guest, and as he continues hitting the road with Dennis Miller in their sought after national tour.<br/><br/>Here are the answers to those inevitable O\'Reilly biographical questions: he was raised on Long Island, got his BA in history from Marist College, a Master\'s in Broadcast Journalism from Boston University, and a second MA in Public Administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.<br/><br/>Bill\'s first professional love was history and he taught it in high school before going into broadcasting. He\'s also collected important historical documents for a long time.<br/><br/>Hard as it is to imagine, some day, perhaps, Bill will slow down. But not now. He still has a long way to go, and a great deal to accomplish.

The group signed with Simon Cowell\'s record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction\'s four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Live While We\'re Young\", and \"Story of My Life\". Their fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., was released in November 2015.<br/><br/>Their achievements include six Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, seven American Music Awards (including Artist of the Year in 2014 and 2015), and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others.

They were proclaimed 2012\'s \"Top New Artist\" by Billboard.

In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014. In June 2015, Forbes listed their earnings at $130 million for the previous twelve months, and ranked them the fourth highest earning celebrities in the world.<br/><br/>After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Their third album, Midnight Memories, was the biggest-selling album worldwide of 2013 despite being released in late November. The band\'s Where We Are Tour in support of Midnight Memories and Four, was the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014, and the highest-grossing tour ever by a vocal group, generating $282 million. In 2014, Billboard named One Direction Artist of the Year.

I did some goofy things as an adolescent: I learned all the constellations in the Western Hemisphere; I tried to set the Guinness World Record for crawling; I built a boat out of milk cartons, then convinced my twin and two friends to join me on the river, then waded to shore with them when it broke up in the first rapid. These adventures and more are part of my latest book, The Gutsy Girl: Escapades for Your Life of Epic Adventure, written especially for 7-11 year-old girls. <br/><br/>I graduated from Stanford University, where I studied Communications. At the time I had a vague idea that perhaps I would become a documentary filmmaker. Instead, in 1989, I became a San Francisco firefighter.<br/><br/>I wrote about my thirteen and a half year career in Fighting Fire, an updated version of which came out in 2012. I\'d tell you about those years, but really, you should just read the book. I will only say that being in a fire made me happy, and doing emergency medical work intrigued me. All of it made me a better person.<br/><br/>The most remote place I\'ve been is Siberia, where I saw a Unidentified Flying Object that may or may not have been the Soviet military. The highest place I\'ve been was on a mountain bike in the Bolivian Alps back when mountain bikes were scarce and 15,000 feet didn\'t hurt as much as it would now. The most isolated I\'ve ever felt was in a blizzard on the mountain of Denali, where we had to stay in the tent and pee into a Gatorade bottle.<br/><br/>My novel East Wind, Rain came out in 2006. It is based closely on the little known but true story  some call \"the battle of Niihau,\" that begins when a Japanese pilot who has just attacked Pearl Harbor is forced to crash land on an isolated Hawaiian island. The inhabitants there have no communication with the outside world, and are puzzled by his sudden, dramatic arrival. The book follows the next seven days, as the seemingly mysterious event divides the villagers and disrupts a once peaceful paradise. A movie based on the book is in the works. <br/><br/>In 2013 my third book, Lost Cat, A True Story of Love, Desperation, and GPS Technology, was published. It\'s about my obsessive to search to figure out where my cat journeyed when I was not around and entailed GPS tracking, video, psychics and animal communicators. Despite the title, it\'s really about how lost humans can get, and how it is animals that can help them regain their bearings. Lost Cat was named a Best Book by Jezebel and by the influential website Brainpickings. That film is also in the works.<br/><br/>My latest book is The Gutsy Girl, Escapades for Your Life of Epic Adventure. Part memoir, part how-to adventure guide, this book for 7-11 year-olds is best described as Lean in for girls, set not in a boardroom, but in trees, on cliff edges and down wild rivers (and boys should read this too, so they grow up knowing that girls are gutsy too.) Bonus: it\'s illustrated by the amazing Wendy MacNaughton! I wrote this book because I believe that girls aren\'t encouraged to be gutsy, and so miss out on the things that adventure teaches so well: resilience, self-confidence, courage, and decision-making. <br/><br/>Writing never happens in a vaccuum. I\'ve been part of the San Francisco Writers Grotto since 1999; without that community I would have quit this strange career, or gone insane, years ago. I\'m also constantly inspired by my kickass siblings: my identical twin is the accomplished actress Alexandra Paul and my brother is the righteous animal rights activist Jonathan Paul.<br/><br/>In my free time, I fly an experimental plane. I read books. I go to movies. I surf (badly.) Much of this is done around San Francisco, where I live with my partner, the artist Wendy MacNaughton, two shelter cats, one shelter dog, an array of solar panels, and countless unread back issues of the New Yorker.\n                </span>',1,'2016-04-09','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1puJzT8RtS._UX250_.jpg'),(184,'Cassandra','Clare','<span>\n                    \n                    Cassandra Clare is the author of the #1 New York Times, USA TODAY, Wall Street Journal, and Publishers Weekly bestselling Mortal Instruments series and the Infernal Devices trilogy, and coauthor of the Bane Chronicles with Sarah Rees Brennan and Maureen Johnson.

She was born in Hawaii and grew up in New York, Pennsylvania, and Japan. After several years at Brown University, she turned to her family and to writing.

To learn more about Lois Lowry, see her website at www.loislowry.com<br/><br/>author interview<br/>A CONVERSATION WITH LOIS LOWRY ABOUT THE GIVER<br/><br/>Q. When did you know you wanted to become a writer?<br/><br/>A. I cannot remember ever not wanting to be a writer.<br/><br/>Q. What inspired you to write The Giver? <br/><br/>A. Kids always ask what inspired me to write a particular book or how did I get an idea for a particular book, and often it\'s very easy to answer that because books like the Anastasia books come from a specific thing; some little event triggers an idea. But a book like The Giver is a much more complicated book, and therefore it comes from much more complicated places--and many of them are probably things that I don\'t even recognize myself anymore, if I ever did. So it\'s not an easy question to answer. <br/><br/>I will say that the whole concept of memory is one that interests me a great deal. I\'m not sure why that is, but I\'ve always been fascinated by the thought of what memory is and what it does and how it works and what we learn from it. And so I think probably that interest of my own and that particular subject was the origin, one of many, of The Giver.<br/><br/>Q. How did you decide what Jonas should take on his journey?<br/><br/>A. Why does Jonas take what he does on his journey? He doesn\'t have much time when he sets out. He originally plans to make the trip farther along in time, and he plans to prepare for it better. But then, because of circumstances, he has to set out in a very hasty fashion. So what he chooses is out of necessity. He takes food because he needs to survive. He takes the bicycle because he needs to hurry and the bike is faster than legs. And he takes the baby because he is going out to create a future. And babies always represent the future in the same way children represent the future to adults. And so Jonas takes the baby so the baby\'s life will be saved, but he takes the baby also in order to begin again with a new life.<br/><br/>Q. When you wrote the ending, were you afraid some readers would want more details or did you want to leave the ending open to individual interpretation?<br/><br/>A. Many kids want a more specific ending to The Giver. Some write, or ask me when they see me, to spell it out exactly. And I don\'t do that. And the reason is because The Giver is many things to many different people. People bring to it their own complicated beliefs and hopes and dreams and fears and all of that. So I don\'t want to put my own feelings into it, my own beliefs, and ruin that for people who create their own endings in their minds.<br/><br/>Q. Is it an optimistic ending? Does Jonas survive?<br/><br/>A. I will say that I find it an optimistic ending. How could it not be an optimistic ending, a happy ending, when that house is there with its lights on and music is playing? So I\'m always kind of surprised and disappointed when some people tell me that they think the boy and the baby just die. I don\'t think they die. What form their new life takes is something I like people to figure out for themselves. And each person will give it a different ending. I think they\'re out there somewhere and I think that their life has changed and their life is happy, and I would like to think that\'s true for the people they left behind as well.<br/><br/>Q. In what way is your book Gathering Blue a companion to The Giver?<br/><br/>A. Gathering Blue postulates a world of the future, as The Giver does. I simply created a different kind of world, one that had regressed instead of leaping forward technologically as the world of The Giver has. It was fascinating to explore the savagery of such a world. I began to feel that maybe it coexisted with Jonas\'s world . . . and that therefore Jonas could be a part of it in a tangential way. So there is a reference to a boy with light eyes at the end of Gathering Blue. He can be Jonas or not, as you wish.\n                </span>',1,'2016-04-09','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31jd27CvmUL._UX250_.jpg'),(195,'Lincoln','Peirce','<span>\n                    \n                    Lincoln Peirce (pronounced \"purse\") is a New York Times bestselling author and cartoonist/writer in Portland, Maine.

Instead, she prefers to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. The New York Times recently acknowledged Mary Oliver as \"far and away, this country\'s best-selling poet.\" Born in a small town in Ohio, Oliver published her first book of poetry in 1963 at the age of 28; No Voyage and Other Poems, originally printed in the UK by Dent Press, was reissued in the United States in 1965 by Houghton Mifflin. Oliver has since published many works of poetry and prose. As a young woman, Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but took no degree. She lived for several years at the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in upper New York state, companion to the poet\'s sister Norma Millay. It was there, in the late \'50s, that she met photographer Molly Malone Cook. For more than forty years, Cook and Oliver made their home together, largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook\'s death in 2005. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver has received numerous awards. Her fourth book, American Primitive, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She has also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for House of Light; the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence. Oliver\'s essays have appeared in Best American Essays 1996, 1998, 2001; the Anchor Essay Annual 1998, as well as Orion, Onearth and other periodicals. Oliver was editor of Best American Essays 2009. Oliver\'s books on the craft of poetry, A Poetry Handbook and Rules for the Dance, are used widely in writing programs. She is an acclaimed reader and has read in practically every state as well as other countries. She has led workshops at various colleges and universities, and held residencies at Case Western Reserve University, Bucknell University, University of Cincinnati, and Sweet Briar College. From 1995, for five years, she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College. She has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Art Institute of Boston (1998), Dartmouth College (2007) and Tufts University (2008).

His first self-published book, Clumsy, appeared seemingly out of nowhere to grab attention from both cartoonists and comics fans. Established as an overly sensitive chronicler of bittersweet adolescent romance and nonsense superhero parody, Brown\'s current direction remains split between more autobiography examining the minutiae of everyday life and whatever humorous fiction he feels in the mood for. His most popular works include Clumsy, Unlikely, AEIOU, and Every Girl is the End of the World For Me, comprising the so-called \"Girlfriend Trilogy\" and its epilogue. More recently his autobiographical work has included Little Things and Funny Misshapen Body. His parody The Incredible Change-Bots, the Ignatz Award winning I am going to be small and humorous cat book Cat Getting Out Of A Bag all stand out amongst his humor work, while his Sulk series continues to take on a variety of subjects with satire. Jeffrey\'s work has appeared in a host of anthologies from McSweeney\'s to The Best American Comics, as well as mainstream books like The Simpson\'s Treehouse of Horror and Marvel\'s Strange Tales.

Evans displays videos of the comically talentless, egotistical and quirky character on her YouTube channel. In these videos, the eccentric, narcissistic, yet endearing character sings and dances badly, gives inept \"\"tutorials\"\", recounts her daily activities, discusses current events that she often misunderstands, collaborates with other YouTubers, and rants about her critics, reading examples of hate mail directed at the character on social media; she responds to them with her catchphrase: \"\"Haters Back Off!\"\".<br/><br/>Evans created the character as a satire of bad but arrogant singers who believe that posting their videos on YouTube will lead to them breaking into show business. As of December 2015, the Miranda Sings YouTube channel had surpassed 800 million views and 5.8 million subscribers. Miranda has been ranked the 7th \"\"most popular\"\" YouTube personality by Daily American and the channel was ranked No. 38 of all time by NewMediaRockstars. The character also has an active presence on other social media.<br/><br/>Since 2009, in addition to her internet videos, Evans has regularly presented live comedy acts, in character as Miranda Sings, at first in cabaret spaces and later in theaters in New York, London, and other cities in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and elsewhere. Her acts include Miranda\'s signature off-key singing of pop music hits and show tunes, with introductions focusing on the character\'s backstory. Her delivery is full of malapropisms, mondegreens and spoonerisms, and the acts incorporate interaction with audience volunteers, giving a \"\"voice lesson\"\" to, or singing a duet with, Broadway or other musical celebrities, reading hate mail, and singing while being stabbed through the neck in her \"\"magic trick\"\". The character has appeared in web series, interviews and an episode of the TV show Victorious. In each of 2014 and 2015, Evans was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for her Miranda videos, winning the award in 2015. She was also nominated for 2015 Streamy Awards, winning one. In 2014, she guest-starred in character on an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In July 2015, she released a New York Times #1 best-selling book, written in Miranda\'s voice, titled Selp-Helf. Miranda is expected to appear in the Netflix-original series Haters Back Off.<br/>Bio from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The second eldest of Trywell and Agnes Kamkwamba\'s seven children, William has six sisters.<br/>William was educated at Wimbe Primary School, completing 8th grade and was then accepted to Kanchokolo secondary school. Due to severe famine in 2001-2002, his family lacked the funds to pay the $80 in annual school fees and William was forced to drop out of school midway through his freshman year. For five years he was unable to go to school. <br/><br/>Windmill and other projects<br/>Starting at 14, rather than accept his fate, William started borrowing books from a small community lending library located at his former primary school. He borrowed a 5th grade American textbook called Using Energy, which depicted a wind turbine on its cover. He decided to build a windmill to power his family\'s home and obviate the need for kerosene, which provided only smoky, flickering, distant and expensive light after dark.   First he built a prototype, then his initial 5-meter windmill out of a broken bicycle, tractor fan blade, old shock absorber, and blue gum trees. He was able to power four light bulbs and two radios, and charge neighbors\' mobile phones. He then rebuilt a 12 meter windmill to better catch the wind above the trees, and added a car battery for storage, as well as homemade light switches and circuit breakers. He also experimented with building a radio transmitter to broadcast popular music interspersed with HIV prevention messages.<br/><br/>Subsequent projects have included clean water, malaria prevention, solar power and lighting for the six homes in his family compound, a deep water well with a solar powered pump for clean water, a drip irrigation system, and the outfitting of the village team Wimbe United with their first ever uniforms and shoes. Since receiving their sun and wind-themed uniforms, the team has been on a winning streak that has brought the village together with pride. William recently built yet another windmill to pump grey water for irrigation.<br/><br/>The windmill project drew many visitors from kilometers around, including Dr. Hartford Mchazime, Ph.D., the deputy director of the MTTA, the Malawian NGO responsible for the community library. Mchazime brought press, including The Malawi Daily Times, who wrote a long story. Soyapi Mumba and Mike McKay, engineers at Baoabab Health Project in Malawi blogged about the article, and news of William\'s inventions reached Emeka Okafor, program director for TEDGlobal, a prestigious gathering of thinkers and innovators. Okafor searched quite diligently to find William and invite him to the conference as a fellow. William\'s presentation led to additional mentors, donors, and companies supporting his education and further projects.<br/><br/>Playwright<br/>Kamkwamba also wrote and performed a HIV prevention comedy with his six best friends, entitled You Can\'t Judge a Book by its Cover to over 500 villagers on three occasions. <br/><br/>Education<br/>Thanks to hard work and fundraising by Dr. Mchazime, William finally re-enrolled in high school at Madisi secondary school where he spent one trimester, and then transferred to African Bible College Christian Academy, a private prep school in the capital city of Lilongwe. He completed his first full year back in school in June 2008. During summer 2008 he studied immersion English at Regents Language Institute in Cambridge, UK. <br/>In September, 2008, William started as one of 97 inaugural students at the African Leadership Academy, a new pan-African prep school based outside of Johannesburg, South Africa whose mission is to educate the next generation with rigorous academics, ethical leadership training, entrepreneurship and design (africanleadershipacademy.org).<br/><br/>Speaking<br/>Kamkwamba was a fellow at the prestigious TEDGlobal Conference in Arusha, Tanzania where he spoke briefly (video at ted.com) and spoke at the World Economic Forum Africa (weforum.org) meeting in Cape Town, June 2008 where he keynoted the AMD-sponsored technology pre-conference, and spoke on a panel. He spoke at International CES in January, 2009, the grand opening of the African Leadership Academy in February, 2009, the Africa Economic Forum at Columbia University in March, 2009 and will talk at the Aspen Ideas Festival and TEDGlobal 2009 (both July, 2009)<br/><br/>Documentary Film<br/>William is the subject of a documentary short film Moving Windmills, produced by Tom Rielly and directed and edited by Ari Kushnir and Scott Thrift of M ss g P eces which was selected as one of 50 films out of 2500+ entries for Pangea Day, a worldwide film which took place May 10, 2008 in six cities around the world. The film won the North American Filmmaker\'s Award from Participant Productions, producers of An Inconvenient Truth, Good Night and Good Luck and Charlie Wilson\'s War. See the film at http://missingpiecesvideo.com/kamkwamba/movingwindmillsFINALsubtitle.mov.  Building on their initial success, Tom Rielly and Ben Nabors are currently directing and producing a full-length documentary on Kamkwamba.<br/><br/>Exhibit<br/>Kamkwamba is one of a dozen innovators featured in a new one year exhibit Driving Force: Visionaries Redefining our World, which opened September 3, 2008 at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago (www.msichicago.org). The exhibit features the aforementioned film, photos, and actual hand-made electro-mechanical devices built by William.<br/><br/>Book<br/>William is currently finishing his autobiography The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope with co-author Bryan Mealer (author of All Things Must Fight to Live a history of the recent civil war in Congo). William Morrow, an imprint of Harper Collins will publish the book worldwide September 29, 2009.<br/><br/>Media<br/>Kamkwamba was profiled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal December 8, 2007, as well in major articles in The Malawi Daily Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, La Repubblica, and myriad blog posts such as Boing Boing, and his blog has been featured on the front page of news aggregators such as Digg and Reddit.

It was during the 1995 playoffs, Chicago vs. Charlotte, after a practice at the arena in Charlotte. He was walking out of the building with a group of reporters following. Walking backwards, I was leading the pack, with my tape recorder in his face, interviewing as we walked. I was a foot from walking off the loading dock at the back of the arena, about a 10 foot fall onto concrete, when he reached out and grabbed my arm to stop me from going over the edge. <br/>So when I say that I have an interest in Jordan, I mean it.<br/>I\'ve written a new biography, Michael Jordan, The Life, set to be released by Little, Brown on May 6, 2014. His is a very big life, and the book was an immense challenge to write but oh so fascinating, as was the Jerry West bio I wrote in 2010 for ESPN Books/Random House.<br/>I like to write about competitive personalities, especially those in the NBA. I like to write about their families. Among the zillion questions I had about MJ, I wanted to know where he came from, who the Jordans were. They were moonshiners, making and selling illegal liquor on North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain. So that\'s where his hard edge came from, I thought upon discovering who they were. Just about all the farmers and sharecroppers were moonshiners back in the day. That was their cash crop, the one that kept the family fed. They were tough-minded people, just like Jordan himself.<br/>I\'ve written a book that builds his life from that background. Starting at the beginning, with the birth of his great grandfather Dawson Jordan, allows me to take the reader through the process of his family, his background, and the nurturing of his vast competitive nature. What\'s more, it\'s immensely fun to track his rise. I enjoyed writing about the sharecroppers on North Carolina\'s Coastal Plain, just as I enjoyed writing about the coal miners and frontier settlers in Jerry West\'s background in West Virginia.<br/>I see it as connecting all of the important cultural dots in the backgrounds of iconic figures.\n                </span>',1,'2016-03-26','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/11TdyLXfG0L._UX250_.jpg'),(350,'Mariano','Rivera','Mariano Rivera was a New York Yankee for nineteen seasons.

At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL’s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world.\n      <br>\n       <br>\n        In\n        <i>\n         The Third Wave\n        </i>\n        , which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies.\n        <br>\n         <br>\n          We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the “Third Wave” of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we’re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major “real world” sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food—and in the process change the way we live our daily lives.

One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated.\n <i>\n  When Breath Becomes Air\n </i>\n chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’”\n <i>\n  When Breath Becomes Air\n </i>\n is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  Praise for\n  <i>\n   When Breath Becomes Air\n  </i>\n </b>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “I guarantee that finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option. . . . Part of this book’s tremendous impact comes from the obvious fact that its author was such a brilliant polymath. And part comes from the way he conveys what happened to him—passionately working and striving, deferring gratification, waiting to live, learning to die—so well. None of it is maudlin. Nothing is exaggerated.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion.

Even in this age of helicopter parenting, the mothers and fathers of tomorrow’s women have little idea what their daughters are up to sexually or how they feel about it.

Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers?\n <br/>\n The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against “big government” led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.\n <br/>\n The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs—that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom—are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws.\n <br/>\n The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.\n <br/>\n When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible “philanthropy.”\n <br/>\n These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the\n <i>\n  Citizens United\n </i>\n decision—a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network.\n <br/>\n The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.\n <br/>\n Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy.\n <br/>\n <i>\n  Dark Money\n </i>\n is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.\n</div>\n'),(33,'9780544272880','THE IMMORTAL IRISHMAN','The life of Thomas Francis Meagher, an Irish revolutionary who fled to America and became the general of New York’s Irish Brigade during the Civil War.','2016-04-09','Hardcover Nonfiction','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9780544272880.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/The-Immortal-Irishman-Revolutionary-American/dp/0544272889?tag=thenewyorktim-20',33,'Houghton Mifflin Harcourt','<div>\n <div>\n  <b>\n   From the National Book Award–winning and best-selling author Timothy Egan comes the epic story of one of the most fascinating and colorful Irishman in nineteenth-century America.\n  </b>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The Irish-American story, with all its twists and triumphs, is told through the improbable life of one man.

He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrifice—and pioneering surgery—he recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir.\r\n   <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n     Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Wooden’s death at age ninety-nine.\r\n     <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n       Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended.

Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, “Love don’t pay the bills.” She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America’s vast inequality—and to people’s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <i>\n  From the Hardcover edition.\n </i>\n</div>\n'),(41,'9780307408877','DEAD WAKE','The tragic final voyage of the luxury ship Lusitania, sunk by a German submarine in 1915.','2016-04-09','Paperback Nonfiction, Expeditions Disasters and Adventures','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9780307408860.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Wake-Last-Crossing-Lusitania/dp/0307408868?tag=thenewyorktim-20',41,'Crown','<div>\n <b>\n  #1 New York Times Bestseller\n  <br>\n   <br>\n    From the bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the\n    <i>\n     Lusitania\n    </i>\n   </br>\n  </br>\n </b>\n <br>\n  <br>\n   On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants.

But the\n   <i>\n    Lusitania\n   </i>\n   was one of the era’s great transatlantic “Greyhounds”—the fastest liner then in service—and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of\n     <i>\n      Unterseeboot\n     </i>\n     -20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger’s U-boat, but told no one.

According to historian Joseph Ellis,\n  <b>\n   <i>\n    Alexander Hamilton\n   </i>\n  </b>\n  is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.\n  <br/>\n  Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure.

The emotional heart of the tale lies with Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not only to regain his shattered self-regard but also to find a real place for himself in the world.

Trying to escape her troubled past and rehabilitate a career on the rocks, the former New York City cop hardly expects her lush and wealthy surroundings to be a hotbed of grisly depravity. But when a Hollywood power broker and his mistress are found dead in the abandoned Murder House, the gruesome crime scene rivals anything Jenna experienced in Manhattan. And what at first seems like an open and shut case turns out to have as many shocking secrets as the Murder House itself, as Jenna quickly realizes that the mansion\'s history is much darker than even the town\'s most salacious gossips could have imagined. As more bodies surface, and the secret that Jenna has tried desperately to escape closes in on her, she must risk her own life to expose the truth--before the Murder House claims another victim.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Full of the twists and turns that have made James Patterson the world\'s #1 bestselling writer, THE MURDER HOUSE is a chilling, page-turning story of murder, money, and revenge.\n <br/>\n</div>\n'),(59,'9781476789644','LUCKIEST GIRL ALIVE','The life of a successful New York magazine writer is shaken when secrets from her past are revealed.','2016-04-09','Trade Fiction Paperback','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781476789651.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Luckiest-Girl-Alive-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B00LD1OITO?tag=thenewyorktim-20',55,'Simon & Schuster','<div>\n <b>\n  ***AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES AND USA TODAY BESTSELLER***\n </b>\n <br>\n  <br>\n   <b>\n    Fans of\n    <i>\n     Gone Girl\n    </i>\n    and\n    <i>\n     The Girl on the Train\n    </i>\n    will thrill at “the perfect page-turner to start your summer” (\n    <i>\n     People\n    </i>\n    , Book of the Week):\n    <i>\n     Luckiest Girl Alive\n    </i>\n    —described by Reese Witherspoon as “one of those reads you just can’t put down!”\n   </b>\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     <b>\n      “\n      <i>\n       Loved Gone Girl\n      </i>\n      ?

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time.\n   <i>\n    World War Z\n   </i>\n   is the result.

Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, “By excluding the human factor, aren’t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it?

Jared Cohen is the director of Google Ideas and a former adviser to secretaries of state Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. With their combined knowledge and experiences, the authors are uniquely positioned to take on some of the toughest questions about our future: Who will be more powerful in the future, the citizen or the state? Will technology make terrorism easier or harder to carry out? What is the relationship between privacy and security, and how much will we have to give up to be part of the new digital age?\n    <br>\n     <br>\n      In this groundbreaking book, Schmidt and Cohen combine observation and insight to outline the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades. At once pragmatic and inspirational, this is a forward-thinking account of where our world is headed and what this means for people, states and businesses.\n      <br>\n       <br>\n        With the confidence and clarity of visionaries, Schmidt and Cohen illustrate just how much we have to look forward to—and beware of—as the greatest information and technology revolution in human history continues to evolve. On individual, community and state levels, across every geographical and socioeconomic spectrum, they reveal the dramatic developments—good and bad—that will transform both our everyday lives and our understanding of self and society, as technology advances and our virtual identities become more and more fundamentally real.\n        <br>\n         <br>\n          As Schmidt and Cohen’s nuanced vision of the near future unfolds, an urban professional takes his driverless car to work, attends meetings via hologram and dispenses housekeeping robots by voice; a Congolese fisherwoman uses her smart phone to monitor market demand and coordinate sales (saving on costly refrigeration and preventing overfishing); the potential arises for “virtual statehood” and “Internet asylum” to liberate political dissidents and oppressed minorities, but also for tech-savvy autocracies (and perhaps democracies) to exploit their citizens’ mobile devices for ever more ubiquitous surveillance.

The Way of the Knife is the untold story of that shadow war: a campaign that has blurred the lines between soldiers and spies and lowered the bar for waging war across the globe. America has pursued its enemies with killer drones and special operations troops; trained privateers for assassination missions and used them to set up clandestine spying networks; and relied on mercurial dictators, untrustworthy foreign intelligence services, and proxy armies. This new approach to war has been embraced by Washington as a lower risk, lower cost alternative to the messy wars of occupation and has been championed as a clean and surgical way of conflict. But the knife has created enemies just as it has killed them. It has fomented resentments among allies, fueled instability, and created new weapons unbound by the normal rules of accountability during wartime.  Mark Mazzetti tracks an astonishing cast of characters on the ground in the shadow war, from a CIA officer dropped into the tribal areas to learn the hard way how the spy games in Pakistan are played to the chain-smoking Pentagon official running an off-the-books spy operation, from a Virginia socialite whom the Pentagon hired to gather intelligence about militants in Somalia to a CIA contractor imprisoned in Lahore after going off the leash. At the heart of the book is the story of two proud and rival entities, the CIA and the American military, elbowing each other for supremacy. Sometimes, as with the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, their efforts have been perfectly coordinated. Other times, including the failed operations disclosed here for the first time, they have not. For better or worse, their struggles will define American national security in the years to come.\r\n\r\n'),(120,'9780393081572','GULP','A science writer’s pilgrimage down the digestive tract; by the author of “Stiff,” “Spook,” “Bonk” and “Packing for Mars.”','2013-04-27','Combined Print Nonfiction','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9780393240306.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Gulp-Adventures-Alimentary-Mary-Roach-ebook/dp/B00AN86JZ4?tag=thenewyorktim-20',105,'Norton','<div>\n <p>\n  The irresistible, ever-curious, and always best-selling Mary Roach returns with a new adventure to the invisible realm we carry around inside.\n </p>\n <br/>\n “America’s funniest science writer” (\n <em>\n  Washington Post\n </em>\n ) takes us down the hatch on an unforgettable tour.

So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.\n     <br>\n      <br>\n       Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater.

On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can’t have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.\n </p>\n <p>\n  During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she\'s chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she\'s kept hidden from everyone because she\'s been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Debut author Veronica Roth bursts onto the YA scene with the first book in the Divergent series—dystopian thrillers filled with electrifying decisions, heartbreaking betrayals, stunning consequences, and unexpected romance.\n </p>\n <strong>\n </strong>\n <span class=\"h1\">\n  <strong>\n   A Q&amp;A with Author Veronica Roth\n  </strong>\n </span>\n <br/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Q:\n  </strong>\n  What advice would you offer to young aspiring writers, who long to live a success story like your own?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Roth:\n  </strong>\n  One piece of advice I have is: Want something else more than success. Success is a lovely thing, but your desire to say something, your worth, and your identity shouldn’t rely on it, because it’s not guaranteed and it’s not permanent and it’s not sufficient. So work hard, fall in love with the writing—the characters, the story, the words, the themes—and make sure that you are who you are regardless of your life circumstances. That way, when the good things come, they don’t warp you, and when the bad things hit you, you don’t fall apart.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Q:\n  </strong>\n  You’re a young author--is it your current adult perspective or not-so-recent teenage perspective that brought about the factions in the development of this story? Do you think that teens or adults are more likely to fit into categories in our current society?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Roth:\n  </strong>\n  Other aspects of my identity have more to do with the factions than my age. The faction system reflects my beliefs about human nature—that we can make even something as well-intentioned as virtue into an idol, or an evil thing. And that virtue as an end unto itself is worthless to us. I did spend a large portion of my adolescence trying to be as “good” as possible so that I could prove my worth to the people around me, to myself, to God, to everyone. It’s only now that I’m a little older that I realize I am unable to be truly “good” and that it’s my reasons for striving after virtue that need adjustment more than my behavior. In a sense,\n  <em>\n   Divergent\n  </em>\n  is me writing through that realization—everyone in Beatrice’s society believes that virtue is the end, the answer. I think that’s a little twisted.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I think we all secretly love and hate categories—love to get a firm hold on our identities, but hate to be confined—and I never loved and hated them more than when I was a teenager. That said: Though we hear a lot about high school cliques, I believe that adults categorize each other just as often, just in subtler ways. It is a dangerous tendency of ours. And it begins in adolescence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Q:\n  </strong>\n  If you could add one more faction to the world within\n  <em>\n   Divergent\n  </em>\n  , what would it be?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Roth:\n  </strong>\n  I tried to construct the factions so that they spanned a wide range of virtues. Abnegation, for example, includes five of the traditional “seven heavenly virtues:” chastity, temperance, charity, patience, and humility. That said, it would be interesting to have a faction centered on industriousness, in which diligence and hard work are valued most, and laziness is not allowed. They would be in constant motion, and would probably be happy to take over for the factionless. And hard-working people can certainly take their work too far, as all the factions do with their respective virtues. I’m not sure what they would wear, though. Overalls, probably.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Q:\n  </strong>\n  What do you think are the advantages, if any, to the society you’ve created in\n  <em>\n   Divergent\n  </em>\n  ?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Roth:\n  </strong>\n  All the advantages I see only seem like advantages to me because I live in our current society. For example, the members of their society don’t focus on certain things: race, religion, sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc. I mean, a world in which you look different from the majority and no one minds? That sounds good to me. But when I think about it more, I realize that they’re doing the exact same thing we do, but with different criteria by which to distinguish ourselves from others. Instead of your skin color, it’s the color of your shirt that people assess, or the results of your aptitude test. Same problem, different system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Q:\n  </strong>\n  What book are you currently reading and how has it changed you, if at all?\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Roth:\n  </strong>\n  I recently finished\n  <em>\n   Imaginary Girls\n  </em>\n  by Nova Ren Suma, which I would call “contemporary with a paranormal twist,” or something to that effect. It’s about a girl whose sister has a powerful kind of magnetism within the confines of a particular town, and how their love for each other breaks some things apart and puts other things back together. It was refreshing to read a young adult book that is about sisterhood instead of romance. It’s one of those books that makes you love a character and then hate a character and then love them again—that shows you that people aren’t all good or all bad, but somewhere in between.\n  <em>\n   Imaginary Girls\n  </em>\n  gave me a lot to think about, and the writing was lovely, which I always love to see.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</div>\n'),(207,'9780316101691','MIDDLE SCHOOL, THE WORST YEARS OF MY LIFE','Rafe breaks every rule in the book.','2012-11-24','Paperback Books','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9780316101875.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Middle-School-Worst-Years-Life/dp/0316101877?tag=thenewyorktim-20',13,'Little, Brown','<div>\n Rafe Khatchadorian has enough problems at home without throwing his first year of middle school into the mix.

What’s it like to be able to smell not just every bit of open food in the house but also to smell sadness in humans, or even the passage of time? How does a tiny dog manage to play successfully with a Great Dane? What is it like to hear the bodily vibrations of insects or the hum of a fluorescent light?

Mesmerized by the intelligence, character, and even humor of the great animals who hauled logs through the remote jungles, he became a gifted “elephant wallah.” Increasingly skilled at treating their illnesses and injuries, he also championed more humane treatment for them, even establishing an elephant “school” and “hospital.” In return, he said, the elephants made him a better man. The friendship of one magnificent tusker in particular, Bandoola, would be revelatory. In\n <i>\n  Elephant Company,\n </i>\n Vicki Constantine Croke chronicles Williams’s growing love for elephants as the animals provide him lessons in courage, trust, and gratitude.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n But\n <i>\n  Elephant Company\n </i>\n is also a tale of war and daring. When Imperial Japanese forces invaded Burma in 1942, Williams joined the elite Force 136, the British dirty tricks department, operating behind enemy lines. His war elephants would carry supplies, build bridges, and transport the sick and elderly over treacherous mountain terrain. Now well versed in the ways of the jungle, an older, wiser Williams even added to his stable by smuggling more elephants out of Japanese-held territory. As the occupying authorities put a price on his head, Williams and his elephants faced his most perilous test. In a Hollywood-worthy climax, Elephant Company, cornered by the enemy, attempted a desperate escape: a risky trek over the mountainous border to India, with a bedraggled group of refugees in tow. Elephant Bill’s exploits would earn him top military honors and the praise of famed Field Marshal Sir William Slim.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Part biography, part war epic, and part wildlife adventure,\n <i>\n  Elephant Company\n </i>\n is an inspirational narrative that illuminates a little-known chapter in the annals of wartime heroism.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  Praise for\n  <i>\n   Elephant Company\n  </i>\n </b>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “This book is about far more than just the war, or even elephants.

Written with the participation of the group\'s key members, including reclusive singer-songwriter Paul Westerberg, bassist Tommy Stinson, and the family of late guitarist Bob Stinson, Trouble Boys is a deeply intimate and nuanced portrait, exposing the primal factors and forces—addiction, abuse, fear—that would shape one of the most brilliant and notoriously self-destructive groups of all time.\r\n\r\nBased on a decade of research and reporting, hundreds of interviews (with family, friends, managers, producers, and musical colleagues), as well as full access to the Replacements\' archives at Twin/Tone and Warner Bros. Records, author Bob Mehr has fashioned something far more compelling than a conventional band bio.\r\n\r\nBeginning with riveting revelations about the band members\' troubled early years—which were scarred by alcoholism and mental health issues—Trouble Boys tracks the group as they rise within the early \'80s American underground and chronicles the making of classic LPs like Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash, and Let It Be.\r\n\r\nSigning to Warner\'s Sire Records, the Replacements became one of the first indie bands to make the transition to the major label world, winning converts thanks to Westerberg\'s rapidly maturing songwriting on records like Tim and Pleased to Meet Me.\r\n\r\nMehr uncovers the darker truths behind the band\'s legendary drinking, showing how their addictions first came to define them and then nearly destroyed them. He offers an in-depth exploration of the life and tragic death of founding member Bob Stinson, who was fired from the group and later passed away at the age of thirty-five. By the end of their twelve-year run in 1991, the band\'s tightly held bonds had frayed as drummer Chris Mars was fired and Westerberg\'s depression, drinking, and desire to go solo became all-consuming. The band\'s break-up came in front of 20,000 people onstage at Chicago\'s Grant Park as they ceremoniously handed off their instruments to their road crew and disappeared, seemingly for good.\r\n\r\nTrouble Boys then traces Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson\'s subsequent efforts to find careers of their own, and it reveals the Replacements\' impact and influence on successive generations of artists—from the Flaming Lips to the Pixies, Nirvana to Green Day, the Wallflowers to Wilco. The book also offers a behind-the-scenes look at the Replacements\' triumphant 2013-2015 reunion, which saw them selling out stadiums, reclaiming their legacy, and re-establishing the complicated brotherhood between Westerberg and Stinson.\r\n\r\nA roaring rock \'n\' roll adventure, a heartrending family drama, and a cautionary showbiz tale, Trouble Boys is a penetrating work of biography and a major addition to the rock book canon.'),(274,'9781501117695','BINGE','Personal essays from the L.G.B.T.Q.

Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year. Krakauer’s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault — and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman’s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  In\n  <i>\n   Missoula\n  </i>\n  , Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula — the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor’s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies’ star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman’s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Krakauer’s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention. They are the victims of a terrible crime and deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken.\n </p>\n</div>\n'),(285,'9781594204180','IMBECILES','A 1927 Supreme Court case on eugenics that led to the mass sterilization of 70,000 Americans.','2016-03-26','Crime and Punishment, Science','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781594204180.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Imbeciles-Supreme-American-Eugenics-Sterilization/dp/1594204187?tag=thenewyorktim-20',243,'Penguin Press','<div>\n <b>\n  One of America’s great miscarriages of justice, the Supreme Court’s infamous 1927\n  <i>\n   Buck v.

It often begins in childhood in a darkened theater, grows into something more serious for high school actors, and reaches its passionate zenith when it comes time for love, marriage, and children, who will start the cycle all over again. Americans love musicals. Americans invented musicals. Americans perfected musicals. But what, exactly, is a musical?\r\n\r\nIn The Secret Life of the American Musical, Jack Viertel takes them apart, puts them back together, sings their praises, marvels at their unflagging inventiveness, and occasionally despairs over their more embarrassing shortcomings. In the process, he invites us to fall in love all over again by showing us how musicals happen, what makes them work, how they captivate audiences, and how one landmark show leads to the next--by design or by accident, by emulation or by rebellion--from Oklahoma! to Hamilton and onward.\r\n\r\nStructured like a musical, The Secret Life of the American Musical begins with an overture and concludes with a curtain call, with stops in between for “I Want” songs, “conditional” love songs, production numbers, star turns, and finales. The ultimate insider, Viertel has spent three decades on Broadway, working on dozens of shows old and new as a conceiver, producer, dramaturg, and general creative force; he has his own unique way of looking at the process and at the people who collaborate to make musicals a reality. He shows us patterns in the architecture of classic shows and charts the inevitable evolution that has taken place in musical theater as America itself has evolved socially and politically.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Life of the American Musical makes you feel as though you’ve been there in the rehearsal room, in the front row of the theater, and in the working offices of theater owners and producers as they pursue their own love affair with that rare and elusive beast--the Broadway hit.'),(294,'9781101946329','THE SILK ROADS','A new history of the world traces civilization along trade routes from East to West which fed the dissemination of culture, religion, and ideas as well as gold, spices, fur and silk.','2016-03-26','Culture','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781101946329.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/The-Silk-Roads-History-World/dp/1101946326?tag=thenewyorktim-20',252,'Knopf','<div>\n <b>\n  <b>\n   “This is history on a grand scale, with a sweep and ambition that is rare… A proper historical epic of dazzling range and achievement.” —William Dalrymple,\n   <i>\n    The Guardian\n   </i>\n  </b>\n  <br>\n   <br>\n    The epic history of the crossroads of the world—the meeting place of East and West and the birthplace of civilization\n   </br>\n  </br>\n </b>\n <br>\n  <br>\n   It was on the Silk Roads that East and West first encountered each other through trade and conquest, leading to the spread of ideas, cultures and religions.

Otherwise, by playing back, you may protect yourself, but you will be less successful in protecting America. \"Play to the edge\" was Hayden\'s guiding principle when he ran the National Security Agency, and it remained so when he ran CIA.  In his view, many shortsighted and uninformed people are quick to criticize, and this book will give them much to chew on but little easy comfort; it is an unapologetic insider\'s look told from the perspective of the people who faced awesome responsibilities head on, in the moment.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n How did American intelligence respond to terrorism, a major war and the most sweeping technological revolution in the last 500 years?  What was NSA before 9/11 and how did it change in its aftermath?  Why did NSA begin the controversial terrorist surveillance program that included the acquisition of domestic phone records? What else was set in motion during this period that formed the backdrop for the infamous Snowden revelations in 2013?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n As Director of CIA in the last three years of the Bush administration,  Hayden had to deal with the rendition, detention and interrogation program as bequeathed to him by his predecessors. He also had to ramp up the agency to support its role in the targeted killing program that began to dramatically increase in July 2008. This was a time of great crisis at CIA, and some agency veterans have credited Hayden with actually saving the agency. He himself won\'t go that far, but he freely acknowledges that CIA helped turn the American security establishment into the most effective killing machine in the history of armed conflict.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n For 10 years, then, General Michael Hayden was a participant in some of the most telling events in the annals of American national security. General Hayden\'s goals are in writing this book are simple and unwavering: No apologies. No excuses. Just what happened. And why. As he writes, \"There is a story here that deserves to be told, without varnish and without spin. My view is my view, and others will certainly have different perspectives, but this view deserves to be told to create as complete a history as possible of these turbulent times. I bear no grudges, or at least not many, but I do want this to be a straightforward and readable history for that slice of the American population who depend on and appreciate intelligence, but who do not have the time to master its many obscure characteristics.\"\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <i>\n  From the Hardcover edition.\n </i>\n</div>\n'),(305,'9781629143606','A MAN CALLED INTREPID','The story of the World War II British spymaster who became Churchill’s secret intelligence ambassador to Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n','2016-03-26','Espionage','http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vdnCwi%2BqL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Man-Called-Intrepid-Incredible-Master-ebook/dp/B00HX1K1J4?tag=thenewyorktim-20',263,'Skyhorse','The classic real-life story of the superspy whose vast intelligence network helped defeat the Nazis in World War II.\r\n\r\nA Man Called Intrepid is the account of the world’s first integrated intelligence operation and of its master, William Stephenson.

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.  How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of\n <i>\n  Into the Wild\n </i>\n .\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir.  In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his  cash.  He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.  Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away.  Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless\'s short life.  Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless.  Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n When McCandless\'s innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris.  He is said  to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless\'s uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity , and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality.

Everest, saw nothing that \"suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down.\" He was wrong. The storm, which claimed five lives and left countless more--including Krakauer\'s--in guilt-ridden disarray, would also provide the impetus for\n   <b>\n    Into Thin Air\n   </b>\n   , Krakauer\'s epic account of the May 1996 disaster.\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     By writing\n     <b>\n      Into Thin Air\n     </b>\n     , Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer\'s highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber\'s death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others\' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself.\n     <br>\n      <br>\n       This updated trade paperback edition of\n       <b>\n        Into Thin Air\n       </b>\n       includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy.  \"I have no doubt that Boukreev\'s intentions were good on summit day,\" writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. \"What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev\'s refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn\'t the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients.\" As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since\n       <b>\n        Into Thin Air\n       </b>\n       \'s denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer\'s tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored\n       <b>\n        The Climb\n       </b>\n       , Boukreev\'s version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer recounts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I.\n       <br>\n        <br>\n         In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters--a prestigious prize intended \"to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment.\"  According to the Academy\'s citation, \"Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer.  His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind.\"\n        </br>\n       </br>\n      </br>\n     </br>\n    </br>\n   </br>\n  </br>\n </br>\n</div>\n'),(318,'9781501106835','THE FINEST HOURS','The story of a dramatic 1952 Coast Guard rescue of men in the broken halves of two oil tankers during a nor\'easter off Cape Cod.

From the housekeeper and engineer who fell in love while serving President Reagan to Jackie Kennedy’s private moment of grief with a beloved staffer after her husband’s assassination to the tumultuous days surrounding President Nixon’s resignation and President Clinton’s impeachment battle, The Residence is full of surprising and moving details that illuminate day-to-day life at the White House.'),(330,'9781501120589','GRACE AND STYLE','In this book subtitled \"The Art of Pretending You Have It,\" the comedian and YouTube personality talks about her \"silly and nonsensical\" approach to fashion, makeup and more.','2016-03-26','Fashion Manners and Customs','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781501120589.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Grace-Style-The-Pretending-Have/dp/1501120581?tag=thenewyorktim-20',285,'Touchstone','<div>\n From the #1\n <i>\n  New York Times\n </i>\n bestselling author of\n <i>\n  Grace’s Guide\n </i>\n and the host of\n <i>\n  The Grace Helbig Show\n </i>\n on E! comes a beautifully illustrated, tongue-in-cheek book about style that lampoons fashion and beauty guides while offering practical advice in Grace Helbig’s trademark sweet and irreverent voice.\n <br>\n  <br>\n   It’s clear to see I’m a style icon; remember, you can’t spell icon without “con.”\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     I love clothes, accessories, and makeup as much as the next lady, man, French bulldog in a sweater, or child whose parents dressed her in a couture Halloween costume, but telling people how they should look doesn’t suit me (clothes pun!).

Sven Beckert’s rich, fascinating book tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in the 1780s, these men captured ancient trades and skills in Asia, and combined them with the expropriation of lands in the Americas and the enslavement of African workers to crucially reshape the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia, and how industrial capitalism gave birth to an empire, and how this force transformed the world.\r\n     <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n       The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, including the vast wealth and disturbing inequalities that are with us today. The result is a book as unsettling as it is enlightening: a book that brilliantly weaves together the story of cotton with how the present global world came to exist.\r\n       <b>\r\n        <br>\r\n         <br/>\r\n        </br>\r\n       </b>\r\n\r\n </p>\r\n</div>\r\n'),(332,'9781455587940','TIMELESS BEAUTY','The supermodel shares tips, secrets and shortcuts to looking great.','2016-03-26','Fashion Manners and Customs','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781455587940.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Timeless-Beauty-Secrets-Shortcuts-Looking/dp/145558794X?tag=thenewyorktim-20',287,'Grand Central','<div>\n In her first book in more than 30 years, supermodel Christie Brinkley shares the secrets she\'s learned on what to eat, how to apply makeup like a pro, and what to wear to look like a knock out.

We chase fads, choose inappropriate materials and unattractive cuts, and waste energy tottering in heels when we could be moving gracefully. Quite simply, we lack the fashion know-how we need to dress professionally and flatteringly.\r\n\r\nAs historian and expert dressmaker Linda Przybyszewski reveals in The Lost Art of Dress, it wasn’t always like this. In the first half of the twentieth century, a remarkable group of women--the so-called Dress Doctors--taught American women how to stretch each yard of fabric and dress well on a budget. Knowledge not money, they insisted, is the key to timeless fashion. Based in Home Economics departments across the country, the Dress Doctors offered advice on radio shows, at women’s clubs, and in magazines. Millions of young girls read their books in school and at 4-H clothing clubs. As Przybyszewski shows, the Dress Doctors’ concerns weren’t purely superficial: they prized practicality, and empowered women to design and make clothing for both the workplace and the home. They championed skirts that would allow women to move about freely and campaigned against impractical and painful shoes. Armed with the Dress Doctors’ simple design principles--harmony, proportion, balance, rhythm, emphasis--modern American women from all classes could learn to dress for all occasions in a way that made them confident, engaged members of society.\r\n\r\nA captivating and beautifully-illustrated look at the world of the Dress Doctors, The Lost Art of Dress introduces a new audience to their timeless rules of fashion and beauty--rules which, with a little help, we can certainly learn again.'),(335,'9780385538657','HOW TO BE PARISIAN WHEREVER YOU ARE','Four Frenchwomen proffer insights on style, culture and romance.','2016-03-26','Fashion Manners and Customs','http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NJ0hoVMLL._SX354_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/How-Parisian-Wherever-You-Are/dp/0385538650?tag=thenewyorktim-20',290,'Doubleday','<div>\r\n <p>\r\n  From four stunning and accomplished French women -- at last -- a fresh and spirited take on what it really means to be a Parisienne: how they dress, entertain, have fun and attempt to behave themselves.\r\n  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    In short, frisky sections, these Parisian women give you their very original views on style, beauty, culture, attitude and men.

His groundbreaking studies show that overeating doesn\'t make you fat; the process of getting fat makes you overeat.

Low-fat diets work against you, by triggering fat cells to hoard more calories for themselves, leaving too few for the rest of the body. This \"hungry fat\" sets off a dangerous chain reaction that leaves you feeling ravenous as your metabolism slows down. Cutting calories only makes the situation worse-creating a battle between mind and metabolism that we\'re destined to lose. You gain more weight, even as you struggle to eat less food.\n </div>\n <div>\n  ALWAYS HUNGRY? turns dieting on its head with a three-phase program that ignores calories and targets fat cells directly.

Fat cells release their excess calories and you lose weight-and inches-without battling cravings and constant hunger. This is dieting without deprivation.\n </div>\n <div>\n  Forget calories.

We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?\r\n\r\nSome of our problems are unique to our time. \"Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\" \"Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!\" \"My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?\"\r\n\r\nBut the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.\r\n\r\nFor years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.\r\n\r\nIn Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Hardcover edition.'),(359,'9781501117947','SELP-HELF','A comedian and YouTube sensation offers her decidedly ironic and unhelpful advice on romance and careers.','2016-03-26','Humor','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9781501117947.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/Selp-Helf-Miranda-Sings-ebook/dp/B00TBKUVEK?tag=thenewyorktim-20',310,'Gallery','<div>\n In this decidedly unhelpful, candid, hilarious “how-to” guide, YouTube personality Miranda Sings offers life lessons and tutorials with her signature sassy attitude.\n <br>\n  <br>\n   Over six million social media fans can’t be wrong: Miranda Sings is one of the funniest faces on YouTube.

At the peak of Red Cloud’s powers the Sioux could claim control of one-fifth of the contiguous United States and the loyalty of thousands of fierce fighters. But the fog of history has left Red Cloud strangely obscured. Now, thanks to the rediscovery of a lost autobiography, and painstaking research by two award-winning authors, the story of our nation’s most powerful and successful Indian warrior can finally be told.\n     <br>\n      <br>\n       Born in 1821 near the Platte River in modern-day Nebraska, Red Cloud lived an epic life of courage, wisdom, and fortitude in the face of a relentless enemy—the soldiers and settlers who represented the “manifest destiny” of an expanding America. He grew up an orphan and had to overcome numerous social disadvantages to advance in Sioux culture. Red Cloud did that by being the best fighter, strategist, and leader of his fellow warriors. As the white man pushed farther and farther west, they stole the Indians’ land, slaughtered the venerated buffalo, and murdered with impunity anyone who resisted their intrusions. The final straw for Red Cloud and his warriors was the U.S. government’s frenzied spate of fort building throughout the pristine Powder River Country that abutted the Sioux’s sacred Black Hills—Paha Sapa to the Sioux, or “The Heart of Everything That Is.”\n       <br>\n        <br>\n         The result was a gathering of angry tribes under one powerful leader. “The white man lies and steals,” Red Cloud told his thousands of braves at council fire. “My lodges were many, now they are few. The white man wants all. They must fight for it.” What came to be known as Red Cloud’s War (1866–1868) culminated in a massacre of American cavalry troops that presaged the Little Bighorn and served warning to Washington that the Plains Indians would fight, and die, for their land and traditions. But many more American soldiers would die first.\n         <br>\n          <br>\n           In\n           <i>\n            The Heart of Everything That Is\n           </i>\n           , Bob Drury and Tom Clavin, the New York Times bestselling authors of\n           <i>\n            Halsey’s Typhoon\n           </i>\n           and\n           <i>\n            The Last Stand of Fox Company\n           </i>\n           , restore Red Cloud to his rightful place in American history in a sweeping and dramatic narrative based on years of primary research.

Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled\n   <i>\n    backward\n   </i>\n   by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun.\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne’s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads—a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being.\n     <br>\n      <br>\n       Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the \"White Squaw\" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860.

What can we learn from Obama\'s major race speeches about his approach to racial conflict and the black criticism it provokes? \r\n<br><br>\r\nDyson explores whether Obama’s use of his own biracialism as a radiant symbol has been driven by the president’s desire to avoid a painful moral reckoning on race.

Graduating from Yale, his options were limitless.\n   <br>\n    <br>\n     He chose public service.\n     <br>\n      <br>\n       He chose to move to a rough neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey, where he worked as a tenants’ rights lawyer before winning a seat on the City Council. In 2006, he was elected mayor, and for more than seven years he was the public face of an American city that had gone decades with too little positive national attention and investment.

His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,” he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts—on the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God’s message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound,\n <i>\n  The Name of God Is Mercy\n </i>\n resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds.

But now he is challenging the entire Church to trek a new way forward.”\n <b>\n  —\n  <i>\n   Time\n  </i>\n </b>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “Francis enjoys sharing personal stories of God’s grace and mercy in the lives of parishioners from his native Argentina, people he has known and who have recognized themselves as sinners.”\n <b>\n  —\n  <i>\n   The Washington Post\n  </i>\n </b>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “Powerful . . .

Wilson in his most impassioned book to date.\n  <em>\n   Half-Earth\n  </em>\n  argues that the situation facing us is too large to be solved piecemeal and proposes a solution commensurate with the magnitude of the problem: dedicate fully half the surface of the Earth to nature.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If we are to undertake such an ambitious endeavor, we first must understand just what the biosphere is, why it\'s essential to our survival, and the manifold threats now facing it. In doing so, Wilson describes how our species, in only a mere blink of geological time, became the architects and rulers of this epoch and outlines the consequences of this that will affect all of life, both ours and the natural world, far into the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Half-Earth\n  </em>\n  provides an enormously moving and naturalistic portrait of just what is being lost when we clip \"twigs and eventually whole braches of life\'s family tree.\" In elegiac prose, Wilson documents the many ongoing extinctions that are imminent, paying tribute to creatures great and small, not the least of them the two Sumatran rhinos whom he encounters in captivity.

This includes a critique of the \"anthropocenists,\" a fashionable collection of revisionist environmentalists who believe that the human species alone can be saved through engineering and technology.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite the Earth\'s parlous condition, Wilson is no doomsayer, resigned to fatalism. Defying prevailing conventional wisdom, he suggests that we still have time to put aside\n  <em>\n   half the Earth\n  </em>\n  and identifies actual spots where Earth\'s biodiversity can still be reclaimed.

For one, when people referenced football they meant soccer. So when Michael’s father suggested he work toward a college scholarship by playing football in Texas, where tens of thousands of people show up for a weekend game, the odds were long. Yet he did, indeed, land a scholarship and from there a draft into the NFL where he scaled the league’s heights, broke records, and helped his team win the Super Bowl as a result of which he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. How? By developing “Strahan’s Rules”—a mix of mental discipline, positive thinking, and a sense of play.

In the tradition of The Perfect Storm and Seabiscuit , the engrossing tale of the fastest boat ride ever down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. In the winter of 1983, the largest El Niño event on record—a chain of “superstorms” that swept in from the Pacific Ocean—battered the entire West. That spring, a massive snowmelt sent runoff racing down the Colorado River toward the Glen Canyon Dam, a 710-foot-high wall of concrete that sat at the head of the most iconic landscape feature in America, the Grand Canyon. As the water clawed toward the parapet of the dam, worried federal officials desperately scrambled to avoid a worst-case scenario: one of the most dramatic dam failures in history.  In the midst of this crisis, beneath the light of a full moon, a trio of river guides secretly launched a small, hand-built wooden boat, a dory named the Emerald Mile, into the Colorado just below the dam’s base and rocketed toward the dark chasm downstream, where the torrents of water released by the dam engineers had created a rock-walled maelstrom so powerful it shifted giant boulders and created bizarre hydraulic features never previously seen. The river was already choked with the wreckage of commercial rafting trips: injured passengers clung to the remnants of three-ton motorboats that had been turned upside down and torn to pieces. The chaos had claimed its first fatality, further launches were forbidden, and rangers were conducting the largest helicopter evacuation in the history of Grand Canyon National Park. An insurgent river run under such conditions seemed to border on the suicidal, but Kenton Grua, the captain of that dory, was on an unusual mission: a gesture of defiance unlike anything the river world had ever seen. His aim was to use the flood as a hydraulic slingshot that would hurl him and two companions through 277 miles of some of the most ferocious white water in North America and, if everything went as planned, catapult the Emerald Mile into legend as the fastest boat ever propelled—by oar, by motor, or by the grace of God—through the heart of the Grand Canyon. Grua himself was already something of a mythic figure, a fearless boatman obsessed with the mysteries of the canyon. His quest embraced not only the trials of the speed run itself but also the larger story of his predecessors: the men who had first discovered the canyon and pioneered its exploration, as well as those who waged a landmark battle to prevent it from being hog-tied by a series of massive hydroelectric dams—a conflict that continues to this day. A writer who has worked as a river guide himself and is intimately familiar with the canyon’s many secrets, Kevin Fedarko is the ideal narrator for this American epic. The saga of The Emerald Mile is a thrilling adventure, as well as a magisterial portrait of the hidden kingdom of white water at the bottom of the greatest river canyon on earth. This book announces Fedarko as a major writing talent and at last sets forth the full story of an American legend—the legend of The Emerald Mile.\r\n'),(410,'9780307389831','WHAT I TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT RUNNING','Part training guide, part memoir, from the Japanese novelist.','2016-03-26','Sports','http://du.ec2.nytimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/prd/books/9780307389831.jpg','http://www.amazon.com/What-About-Running-Vintage-International/dp/0307389839?tag=thenewyorktim-20',355,'Vintage','<div>\n An intimate look at writing, running, and the incredible way they intersect, from the incomparable, bestselling author Haruki Murakami.While simply training for New York City Marathon would be enough for most people, Haruki Murakami\'s decided to write about it as well.

Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. Barbarian Days takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses--off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.\r\n\r\nFinnegan shares stories of life in a whites only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly--he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui--is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria.

Now, in\n <i>\n  West of Eden,\n </i>\n she turns to Los Angeles, the city of her childhood. Stein vividly captures a mythic cast of characters: their ambitions and triumphs as well as their desolation and grief.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n These stories illuminate the bold aspirations of five larger-than-life individuals and their families.\n <i>\n  West of Eden\n </i>\n is a work of history both grand in scale and intimate in detail. At the center of each family is a dreamer who finds fortune and strife in Southern California: Edward Doheny, the Wisconsin-born oil tycoon whose corruption destroyed the reputation of a U.S. president and led to his own son’s violent death; Jack Warner, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, who together with his brothers founded one of the world’s most iconic film studios; Jane Garland, the troubled daughter of an aspiring actress who could never escape her mother’s schemes; Jennifer Jones, an actress from Oklahoma who won the Academy Award at twenty-five but struggled with despair amid her fame and glamour. Finally, Stein chronicles the ascent of her own father, Jules Stein, an eye doctor born in Indiana who transformed Hollywood with the creation of an unrivaled agency and studio.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In each chapter, Stein paints a portrait of an outsider who pins his or her hopes on the nascent power and promise of Los Angeles. Each individual’s unyielding intensity pushes loved ones, especially children, toward a perilous threshold.\n <i>\n  West of Eden\n </i>\n depicts the city that has projected its own image of America onto the world, in all its idealism and paradox. As she did in\n <i>\n  Edie,\n </i>\n Jean Stein weaves together the personal recollections of an array of individuals to create an astonishing tapestry of a place like no other.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  Praise for\n  <i>\n   West of Eden\n  </i>\n </b>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n “Compulsively readable, capturing not just a vibrant part of the history of Los Angeles—that uniquely ‘American Place’ Stein refers to in her subtitle—but also the real drama of this town . . .
